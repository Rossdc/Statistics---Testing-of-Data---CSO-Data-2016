# Statistics---Testing-of-Data---CSO-Data-2016
Five Insights were chosen as part of this analysis of the Census 2016 Small Area Population Statistics  (SAP) report. Themes such as unemployment, commute time and  home ownership levels are explored. As a corollary, all insights  have to some extent been cross referenced with the OSI National  Statistics Boundaries 2015 report so as to explore how these  themes vary across regions.
